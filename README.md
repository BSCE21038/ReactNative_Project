# UpNext - Event Tracker App

**Because missing out is not an option!**  

UpNext is a React Native-based mobile application designed as a one-stop platform for discovering, managing, and promoting events. It provides a seamless experience for both event attendees and organizers, offering ticket booking, event tracking, and management tools.  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- **Event Attendees** â€“ Browse events, register, and receive digital tickets.
